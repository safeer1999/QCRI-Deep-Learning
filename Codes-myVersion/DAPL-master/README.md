This implemented a denoising autoencoder with partial loss (DAPL) as a deep learning based alternative for imputating missing values especially for large datasets, that achieves comparable or better performance than conventional methods with less computational burden.

To run prediction script with trained model and sample test dataset:

python predict_random_missing.py input_name output_name model_path feature_size nonmissing_percent     
e.g., python predict_random_missing.py 'testdata_100sample.csv' 'testloss_100sample.csv' 'models/imputationmodel.ckpt' 17176 0.7

To run training script:

python train_random_missing.py input_name output_path feature_size nonmissing_perc batchsize learning_rate num_epochs

Note: The original training data is not uploaded due to size limitation.
